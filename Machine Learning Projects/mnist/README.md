This project takes in the mnist dataset from keras that consists of 60,000 hand-drawn numbers of pixel size 28x28. Once it has this data, it runs a few layers of standard neural networks to learn to classify the hand-drawn digits correctly. Once it does this, it also outputs a visualization of 25 random images that it guessed incorectly in the test set. I also drew my own image and scaled it down to the correct size and tested it. I then added a visualization for my own personal image as well. This model runs with about a 98% accuracy.
