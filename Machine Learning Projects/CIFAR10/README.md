This project takes in the keras dataset CIFAR10 which consists of 60,000 images of different objects such as dogs, cats, etc. These images are of pixel size 32x32 with 3 RGB channels. This model uses a combination of convolutional neural networks and regular neural networks to accurately predict the classification of each image. This model also incorporates stratgeies such as L2 regularization, batch normalization, data augmentation, and learning rate reduction to try to minimize overfitting. This model also outputs a visualization of 25 misclassified images from the test set at the end. This model was able to run the test set with an accuracy of 82.34%.
